   Dear Dr. Mansoor,</p>

<p>I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my growing concern about the security measures<br>
    currently in place at our college. As a dedicated student, I deeply value the safe and supportive<br>
    environment that our institution strives to provide. However, recent incidents on campus have raised <br>
    significant apprehensions among the student body regarding our overall security.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, there have been reports of unauthorized individuals gaining access to our<br>
    campus facilities. Additionally, several students, including myself, have observed areas around the<br>
    campus where lighting is inadequate, making these spots potentially dangerous during the evening<br>
    hours. These issues have understandably led to a heightened sense of vulnerability among students.</p>

<p>I kindly request a meeting with you or the appropriate security personnel to discuss these concerns and<br>
    potential solutions further. I am confident that, together, we can create a more secure and reassuring<br>
    environment for everyone at college.</p>

<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.</p>
<br>

<p>Yours sincerely,<br>
    Jameel Shah,<br>
